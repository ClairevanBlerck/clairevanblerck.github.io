                    <p>Some people like to have a range from 800 to 2000 grit but we don't find that necessary.</p>

                    <p>Everyone has a different technique. We find that cutting as far away from the piece as possble, and then slowly trimming the nib down with your cutters is the best way to prevent stress marks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be warned</strong>: Hairdryers will affect the whole surface area of the piece and, like in this case, while the marks will dissapear you risk the whole side shrinking and distorting :(</p>
