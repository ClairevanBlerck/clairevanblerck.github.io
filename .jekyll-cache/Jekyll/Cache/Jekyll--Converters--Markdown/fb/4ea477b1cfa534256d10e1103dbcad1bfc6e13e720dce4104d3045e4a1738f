                <h1>Give away!</h1>
                <p>I propagate my plants often, especially some fast growing types like Ceropegia woodii, and my
                    Hoya carnosa mama.</p>
                <p>The thing is, I can't really <em>fit</em> them all into my flat
                    and on top of that I've landed up with quite a few of the same plant.</p>
                <h3>UK only - just pay postage :)</h3>

                <h3>Why am I doing this? What's the catch?</h3>
                <p>No catch at all!</p>
                <p>Plant swops occur all over the UK (and sometimes online or SM!), and unfortunatly they're all too
                    far away from me. I don't have a car and I'm trifty, so setting out on an hour-long journey to a
                    swop isn't always my vibe.</p>
                <p>The plants I've listed here are the most easy-care in my collection, they're tough as nails and
                    have been propagated many times already. If you'd like to give me a plant in return, we could
                    put the postage fees to the side and do a mail-based swop instead!</p>
