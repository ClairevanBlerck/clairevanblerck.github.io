                <h1>Neem oil</h1>
                <p class="date">05 Mar 2020</p>
                <h4>Potentially toxic to childeren and pregnant people if ingested</h4>
                <p>In addition to its use in organic insecticide sprays, this oil has been used for centuries in <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327179#summary" target="blank">medicines</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/skin-care-alphabet-neem-oil-benefits-for-skin-hair-ayurvedic-skincare-ingredient-for-acne">skincare</a>.
                    I haven't myself used it on my skin/hair but there are plenty articles online about its frankly
                    jaw-dropping properties. Personally, I've only held off because I like going quite slow with any
                    new product (I research the hell out of it, then scour the internet for stores, then take up to
                    a month to actualy crack the seal, and then I don't shut up about it).</p>
                <p>Skin/hair benefits aside, this oil does everything I want from an insecticide. The idea is that
                    the oil <em>doesn't harm most beneficial insects</em>, and it doesn't carry the same <a href="https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/insects/insect-control-soaps-and-detergents-5-547/" target="blank">risks to plant health as dishwashing liquid</a>, and <strong>neem oil doubles
                        as a foliar fertiliser</strong>. It works by supressing hormones in the pests, reducing
                    their desire to eat and breed (and generally making the leaves taste bitter). It sounds like a
                    pretty awful way to go I know, but when you can't wipe/spray your pests with water/find ladybugs
                    then you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>

                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>An oil extracted from the neem tree, <em>Azadirachta indica</em> from the Indian subcontinent.
                    Used in medicine, skincare, and argi/horticulture. It has antifungal, antiseptic, antipyretic
                    and antihistamine properties, and can be used as a foliar fertiliser to boost your plants immune
                    system and overall health.</p>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>Mixing the oil with a premixed solution of warm slightly soapy liquid is recommended because it
                    helps the neem oil dissolve. You can tweak the amounts listed below but try keep the principle
                    the same.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix 1 cup warm water with 1/4 teaspoon of eco-friendly dishwashing liquid</li>
                    <li>Add 1/3 teaspoon neem oil, shake, and use immidiately as the oil will start to break down.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Where</h3>
                <p>Your neem oil solution can be sprayed all over the plant leaves, as well as the soil. Some sites
                    recommend using it as a 'soil drench' but I've not had the need to try that.</p>
