                <h1>Calathea Ornata</h1>
                <p class="date">20 Feb 2020</p>
                <h4>Make sure you have the right environment for this plant before you buy it.</h4>
                <p>This is the most temperamental plant in my collection. There's no doubt that it's increadibly
                    beautiful and very rewarding when it's thriving, but getting that balance is <em>really hard
                        work</em>.
                </p>
                <div class="indent">
                    <p>What most websites say about this plant:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>"It's an easy plant"</strong> <em>(no, it isn't!)</em></li>
                            <li><strong>"Requires high humidity"</strong> <em>(okay sure - but how?)</em></li>
                            <li><strong>"Bright indirect light"</strong> <em>(err on either side and your plant will
                                    suffer!)</em></li>
                            <li><strong>"Keep soil moist"</strong> <em>(constantly monitor this one...)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>For the first 6 months (summer to autumn) my plant was happy on my bedside table right next to a
                    north-facing window. I placed stones in its drainage tray and filled that frequently with water.
                    My habit of keeping a glass of H2O by my bed at night = perfect for a quick top-up.
                </p>
                <p>However, during the winter it started to decline...</p>
                <p>First the edges of the leaves became crispy. Then the crispiness spread further into the leaves.
                </p>
                <p>And the plant generally didn't look very happy. There were probably several factors that played a
                    part:
                    <ol>
                        <li>I was watering with hard tap water (275 mg/l CaCO3, which is classified as 'Very Hard' -
                            for real).</li>
                        <li>Having the window open during autumn would have made this princess of a plant too cold.
                        </li>
                        <li>I may have gotten a bit lazy with humidity.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>What I learned (irl)</h2>
                <h3>Light</h3>
                <p>I purchased a growlight for general winter use. I didn't get one of the little ones, I bought a
                    fat
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CPQZBTP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">300W
                        full spectrum growlight.</a> I placed the calathea about 60-70cm and off-centre (the light
                    is most intence directly beneah the light) from the growlight for a few
                    months to see if I could rejuvenate it. The light was on approx. 10 hours a day.</p>
                <h3>Humidity</h3>
                <p>My growlight set up was in my bathroom, so there's plenty humidity each morning (or whenever we
                    showered). In addition I kept a spray bottle next to it and each time I went into the bathroom I
                    gave it a little hello spritz.</p>
                <h3>Water &amp; Fertiliser</h3>
                <p>I live in a (very) hard water area. I originally gave my plant tap water believing that it'd be
                    fine
                    (90% of my indoor plants don't seem to be affected). I changed to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01D50JYAS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">distilled
                        water</a>, which seems extravagant but I can't get much rainwater from my teeeny balcony
                    (though
                    when I can I use this instead).</p>
                <p>I stuck with my <a href="https://www.homebase.co.uk/vitax-organic-seaweed-1l_p412828">seaweed
                        fertiliser</a> and mixed a little into a large tupperware containing the distilled water.
                    Then I
                    placed the plant into this bath so it could drink from the bottom of the pot up.</p>
                <p>This is the biggest change I've made during the cold seasons, as I had a lot of cases of top soil
                    growing mould... While the mould isn't usually a problem itself, I could avoid it by
                    bottom-watering
                    and also prevent any
                    fungus gnat larva from taking up residence in the damp top soil.</p>
                <h3>Pruning</h3>
                <p>Every few weeks I'd cut off one or two of the badly burnt older leaves. I figured that this would
                    give the plant more energy to grow new leaves, and if I spaced the pruning sessions out then any
                    shock the
                    plant would experience from losing some limbs would be minimised.</p>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>THREE new gorgeous leaves and a general sense of happiness from the plant (I'm over the moon).
