                <h2>Cuttings (water method)</h2>
                <p>By far the easiest and most used method (as you'll see from searching "plant cuttings" on eBay). Taking cuttings from a healthy plant is almost foolproof!</p>
                <h3>When</h3>
                <p>Snip off the cutting in the morning, having watered your plant the day before (you need your parent plant at it's most energetic). Cuttings tend to take better during the growing season - spring and summer.</p>
                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>Use a clean blade or scissors to minimise infecting the plant where you make your cut. You could sprinkle some cinnamon on the wound to help make sure it heals fast and fungus-free.</p>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>Cut just above a leaf node. Then trim off the stem of your cutting, and snip off the two lowest leaves - your new roots will grow from this de-leaved node.</p>
                <p>Drop your cutting in a glass of water and keep it in a bright location (no direct sun though). Change the water every few days or when it becomes murky. In a few weeks you should see some new roots appearing!</p>

                <h3>Transplanting to soil</h3>
                <p>Once your cutting has some new roots going, move it into some fresh potting mix.</p>
                <p>Make sure not to use a pot which is too big for your new plant (trust me on this - pot size makes a big difference to whether your watering method &amp; regime actually work).</p>
                <p>Keep the potted plant in a similar environment to when it was in water as you don't want to shock the plant too much at once.</p>
                <h3>No roots?</h3>
                <p>Its possible that the cutting doesn't produce roots but also doesn't deteriorate. Usually this is because the cutting was taken while the parent plant was dormant. In my case it was a cutting I took in Autumn, after 5 months I gave up.</p>

                <h3>Tubers &amp; rhizomes</h3>
                <p>Not all plants have tubers, or rhizomes, or can be divided. I've used this method for my Ceropegi woodii and Sanseviera respectively.</p>
                <h3>When</h3>
                <p>I haven't found that there's a particular time of day/watering cycle/season that's ideal for this method.However, I'd still recommend trying this in the growing seasons to minimise shock and maximise your new plants chances of thriving.</p>
                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>Tubers are like potatoes and are found under the soil. Some plants like Ceropegia woodii also grow tubers on their vines which root when they make contact with soil.</p>
                <p>Rhizomes are also found in your soil like tubers and can be cut to literally break a plant into segments, like with Sanseviera.</p>

            <div class="text-item">
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>Tubers: Either dig up your plant and divide the tubers into new pots with fresh soil, or lay the baby tubers growing on the plant itself on top of some moist soil placed in indirect sun.</p>
                <p>Dividing rhizomes: Carefully remove the parent plant from its pot and slice apart the root/rhizome cluster with a clean sharp blade to divide the parent plant in half. Pot in fresh soil. Optionally sprinkle the wound of each plant with cinnamon to heal it and prevent fungal infection.</p>

                <h2>Cuttings (soil method)</h2>
                <p>I tend to always root my cuttings in water because then I can see the roots grow. A cutting in a glass bottle is also a beautiful alternative to cut flowers.</p>
                <h3>When</h3>
                <p>As with all propagation, this is best done in the growing seasons. I've had success in winter as well, but it took a while for the plant to take.</p>
                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>This method involves placing the cutting directly into your soil medium. Your soil should be prepared carefully, using the recommendations for that plant. You'll need to pay attention to drainage, nutrients, and whether a porous (eg. terracotta) pot or a plastic pot is best.</p>

            <div class="text-item">
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>Take your cutting using the same methods as for the water method if the plant is not a succulent. Poke your finger in the soil (up to your second knuckle) and then gently place your cutting in and move the soil up around the base of the stem</p>
                <p>Succulents: Succulents are super easy to propagate. SImply cut off a peice of break of a leaf. Let it callous on your tabel top for a few days, then lay the leaf on some soil or pop the stem into some soil and let is grow. Keep the soil just moist and place your new plant in indirect sun until it shows signs of new growth. Then move it slowly into direct sun.</p>
                <h3>Rooting hormone</h3>
                <p>Some people help their newly rooted cuttings along by dipping the roots in rooting hormone, cinnamon, or even honey. I've had good results with and without these aids.</p>
