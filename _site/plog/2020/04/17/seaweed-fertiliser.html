                <h1>Seaweed Fertiliser</h1>
                <p class="date">17 Apr 2020</p>
                <h4>The only fertiliser I use</h4>
                <p>So yes, we are creatures of habit and though I may need to add some differently composed fertilisers to my cupboard I really haven't felt the need to until recently. As much as I love this stuff, I've had a few problems with it recently when I tried it as a foliar spray (granted, it may be my technique).</p>
                <p>To be clear, I only use the store-bought brands. I'd love to use fresh kelp, but even when I lived close to the beach I didn't have the time or the space to DIY my fertilisers. This goes for compost tea as well - there's only so much space on a tiny balcony. Regardless I've left some links at the bottom for those of you who're interested.</p>

                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>Liquid seaweed extract: I have no idea of the manufacturing process used, but the <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=301">RHS website</a> states that seaweed "<em>has been used as a soil improver for centuries, particularly in coastal areas</em>" and that seaweed "<em>is rich in trace elements (nutrients that plants only need small amounts of) including <strong>iron, manganese, zince, copper and boron</strong>, which are often lacking in common fertilisers such as Growmore and fish, blood &amp; bone.</em>"</p>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>I've only ever used the liquid, and usually this is sold in a concentrated form. Your ratio should be 1:15 if you're using it for mature plants in soil, other uses are given on the packaging itself.</p>
                <p>I've used these products for so many years that I don't bother reading the instructions, which makes me think I MIGHT be suffering from overconfidence.</p>
                <h3>Where</h3>
                <p>Your seaweed extract solution can be sprayed all over the plant leaves (using a tiny squirt of dishwashing liquid as a surfactant) as well as watered into the soil.</p>
                <h4>Here is where I'll introduce my bad experience</h4>
                <p>I used seaweed extract on a 1:15 ratio as a foliar spray for a sensitive plant which looked to be suffering from a potassium deficiency. The plant improved slightly with 3xdaily sprays (in the shade to prevent leaf burn). After a few days the plant went into a rapid decline. I immidiately washed down the leaves with clean water and after a few days the plant recovered although with visible damage.</p>
                <p>I am willing to accept that the mistake was one of the below, but from my understanding seaweed is <em>not</em> the kind of fertiliser to give your plants nutrient burn or to be overloaded with salts. Next time I'll be way more careful.</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Spraying to frequently</li>
                  <li>Mixing the solution with too much liquid soap</li>
                  <li>Allowing clogged leaves by not rinsinging/wiping them down post-spray</li>
                  <li>Misdiagnosing the ailing plant</li>
                </ul>
