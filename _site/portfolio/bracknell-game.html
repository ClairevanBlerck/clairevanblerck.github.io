        <p>A mobile game about living in a town, and never leaving. <!--Ever. Like, not even if you wanted to buy a house.</p>
        <p>I tried once. I had made the mistake of booking two viewings one Saturday. A tree fell on the train tracks as I tried to leave.</p>
        <p>So, I then tried to find a route going the other direction. Guess what happened?</p>
        <p>Another tree fell on the tracks, the pincers had closed.</p>
        <p>I gave up, and went to The Goose.</p>
        <p>What's "The Goose" you ask?</p>
        <p>I guess I should take it back a bit...</p>
