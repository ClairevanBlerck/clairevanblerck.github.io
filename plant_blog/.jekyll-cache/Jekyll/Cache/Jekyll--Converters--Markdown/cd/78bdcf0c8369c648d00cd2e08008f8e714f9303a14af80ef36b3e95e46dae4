                <h2>Hi!</h2>
                <p>I live in a small one bedroom apartment, and I've filled it however and wherever I can with plants.</p>
                <p>Plant care doesn't have to be difficult or take up time. That's why it can be so rewarding.</p>
                <p>No matter if you have a lack of sunlight or a lack of space in your home (or if you only have 1 plant!) including a bit of vegetation should only make you happier.</p>
                <p>I've shared a few tips and tricks which i've found useful.</p>
